        <h2>The Story of the Tiranga</h2>

        <p>
            The Indian National Flag, known as the Tiranga, was designed by Pingali Venkayya.
            It was adopted on July 22, 1947, just before India's independence.  
            The flag consists of three horizontal stripes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Saffron</b> – Symbolizes courage and sacrifice.</li>
            <li><b>White</b> – Represents truth, peace, and purity.</li>
            <li><b>Green</b> – Stands for prosperity and growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Ashoka Chakra in the center is navy blue with 24 spokes, symbolizing eternal progress and righteousness.  
            The Tiranga is a symbol of national pride, unity, and freedom.

        <h2>History of the Flag</h2>
        <p>
            The journey to our present flag went through several designs since the early 1900s.
            The first national flag was hoisted in 1906 in Calcutta. Later, various versions emerged
            during the freedom struggle, including one with the spinning wheel representing self-reliance.
            The final design was officially adopted on July 22, 1947, and has remained unchanged since.
